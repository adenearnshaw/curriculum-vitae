<h2>Career objectives</h2>

<p>
    I have a career that brings me new challenges every day and always pushes me to continue learning and evolving. As phones have become the defacto device for consuming the majority of content, providing apps to make that experience better is something I love to be a part of.
</p>

<p>
    As an experienced Xamarin Certified developer, I have a wealth of knowledge in the mobile space building and releasing apps for both small and large companies with some of the apps I've contributed to being used by over 20 000 users daily. 
</p>

<p>
    As a C# developer, I'm comfotable in a range of technologies, building products in Xamarin, Android, iOS, ASP.Net Core, UWP, WPF and Angular.  I believe a core fundamental of development is empathy and so UX & design are at the forefront of anything I produce. I am passionate about making sure the products I build are fit for purpose and target their desired audiences, never forgetting future developers who will also have to maintain the code.
