        Sainsbury&apos;s Entertainment on Demand offering was a suite of apps which were some of Sainsbury&apos;s earliest forays into providing digital services to its customers. 
        The suite included apps for browsing digital magazines, browsing &amp; purchasing music, renting &amp; watching movies and an eBook reader. 
        All apps were available on iOS &amp; Android, with the Movies and eBooks apps also available on Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 through a Win UAP app for each.

        Both the Movies and eBooks apps were architected with a similar approach. As was recommended, the apps followed an MVVM pattern to try and maximise code reuse. 
        At their core was shared Portable Class Library which housed code common to both apps, providing helper classes, authorization & authentication providers and other 
        structural code that could be used throughout both apps. 
        Each product then had its own PCL which housed logic specific to the functionality of each app, such as how to handle video streams and buffers; how to parse various eBook formats,
        and provide ViewModels to expose data. 
        By working in this way, my team could share as much code as possible, only having to diverge at the frontend where UI framework APIs differed between WP8 & Win8. With Microsoft releasing 
        Windows 8.1 for both desktop & phone and introducing Shared Projects, we were even able to consolodate the UI code.

        As interest waned in the Entertainment on Demand products, more of my time was diverted to the <a href="/projects/sainsburys-ssa">SmartShop project</a>. With the stability of the 
        shared code from the EoD apps, I was able to quickly build MVP apps to help support the project's progress.
