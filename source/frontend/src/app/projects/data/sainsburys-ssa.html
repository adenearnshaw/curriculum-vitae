    SmartShop is a multi-million pound project undertaken by Sainsbury&apos;s to investigate and trial new technology to
    improve the overall experience for customers shopping within their stores. During my time on the project, I was
    tasked with building and developing software to be used in conjunction with dedicated scanner handsets in-store.

    As part of the project, users were required to create an account and associate their loyalty card. The Registration
    and Sign-In apps were initially built using Windows 8.1 UAP and later ported to Xamarin Forms when the hardware
    requirements
    were changed. During the development of the Sign-In app, I had to work closely with the Android dev team building
    the scanner
    handset software, as the devices needed to communicate with each other. Using MQTT, we were able to setup a channel
    to allow data to be sent back and forth between the centralised sign-in tablets and the individual hand scanners.

    Along with the Sign-In and Registration software, I also helped port a Windows Phone app, used by colleagues, to
    Xamarin Forms after discovering the selected handsets had reliability issues. By using Portable Class Libraries and
    a well-defined N-Tier architecture while building the original app, porting to Xamarin was a simple process with
    only the UI layer and platform specific services requiring any work.

    Since working on the project, there have been over 20 more stores where the handsets and tablets have been deployed
    and the project has evolved further with the recent launch of a completely <a
