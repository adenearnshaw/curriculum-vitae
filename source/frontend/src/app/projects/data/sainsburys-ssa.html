    SmartShop is a multi-million pound project undertaken by Sainsbury&apos;s to investigate and trial new shopping experiences to improve the experiences of all customers within their stores.
    While Sainsbury&apos;s already had some supermarkets fitted with scanners that customers could use to scan their shopping as they went, the handsets were dumb terminals which weren&apos;t easy to use, with most remaining in their cradles.
    Initially SmartShop was put forward as a replacement for the old &apos;Scan &amp; Go&apos; system, but with the added benefit of running on Android devices, allowing for a more interactive experience.
</p>

<p>
    The basic premise was that a shopper would use the SmartShop app on their phone to build their shopping list, then once they reached the store, either scan the items with their own phone, or 
    if they preferred, use their Nectar card to unlock one of the handsets instore, with their Shopping List auto populating on the device. In order for a successful trial, a number of apps were 
    required:

    <ul>
        <li>Native Customer apps for iOS & Android</li>
        <li>Native Android app to run on the instore handset</li>
        <li>Windows 8.1 UAP app to allow non-phone users to register their Nectar card with the program and unlock handsets from their instore cradles</li>
        <li>Windows Phone 8.1 UAP app used by Colleagues to address any issue and provide security checks when required by the system</li>
    </ul>

    As part of a small team, I was responsible for building and maintaining both the Windows apps that customers and colleagues would interact with instore. I worked closely with the developers of
    the Android Handset app so that we could ensure secure and reliable communication between the devices, required to transfer customer&apos;s data from one device to the other and unlock handsets from their cradles.
    <br/>
    The Windows apps were both built with Windows UAP, using Prism as an MVVM framework and following a pattern that we, as a Windows Dev team, had refined whilst building the <a href="/projects/sainsburys-eod" >Entertainment On Demand</a> apps. 
</p>

<p>
    In order to release such a large scale project, the SmartShop team consisted of over 90 members, broken down into smaller feature teams depending on their specialities. The Registration and Login App  
    was a key piece of journey for new users. As we prepared to go live in 2 pilot sites, I was tasked with helping on-site to ensure the installation of the hardware and subsequent deployment of the software went smoothly;
    working with Network engineers, builders, facilities management and store colleagues to minimise the disruption to the store&apos;s trade.    
</p>

<p>
    Throughout the pilot we learnt many things, most importantly (for me), the reliability issue of both Windows devices. The tablets selected for use were not durable enough to withstand 
    the constant use and the Phone devices used by colleagues were too prone to network drop-off to be of any use.
    <br/>
    A decision was made to experiment with Xamarin and see if we could port the Windows Phone Colleague App to one of the Android handsets. Within hours we had a PoC running on the device and had ported the 
    entire app to Xamrin Forms within 2 weeks. Most of the business logic already sat within a PCL, allowing us to import this directly into the Xamarin Forms app, with most of the time spent 
    converting the different flavours of XAML and working out how to port platform specific services from Windows to Android.
    <br/>
    After the success of porting the Colleague App, we moved to migrating the Registration & SignIn app to Xamarin too, redesigning and re-styling the layout as we went, and proving to key 
    stakeholders, that Xamarin was a viable option for producing apps quickly without compromising on the UI.

<p>
    Since working on the project, there have been over 20 more stores where the handsets and tablets have been deployed and the project has been iterated on even further 
    with the recent launch of a completely <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45172631" target="_blank">till-free store</a>.
