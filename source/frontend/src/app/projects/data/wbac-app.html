   The company identified they wanted to migrate their existing agency built Cordova app to a Xamarin Forms app built in-house. As the team had little knowledge in mobile development I was hired to lead the development of the app, educating and guiding the rest of the team in using Xamarin and architecting an enterprise level mobile app.

    The decision to use Forms was already made, however the designs provided by the stakeholders included a highly customised UI. The majority of the styling was achieved using Custom Renderers, but a performance bottleneck on iOS when using the homescreen meant that the app uses a mix of both native layout using Storyboards and Forms layout using Xaml.

    Build and Release pipelines were implemented using Azure Devops, with automatic deployment sending QA versions of the app to AppCenter for Automated and Manual testing. Once happy with the apps, the gated release pipeline could then push the apps to the stores ready for final sign-off and release.

    Initially working with Xamarin Forms 2.3, a lot of custom code was needed to achieve the look and feel desired by the stakeholders. With the recent introduction of Xamarin Forms 4, there is scope to reduce this custom code and utilise the new Shell layout to make maintenance of the code much easier.
