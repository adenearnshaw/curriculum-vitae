    With the original site running a hybrid of ASP MVC and AngularJS with a high degree of latency, the decision was made to migrate to an Angular site with a fresh design.
</p>

<p>
    In order to test the functionality, the site was initially styled identically to the old site so A/B tests could be performed. Once the stakeholder were happy, it was my responsibility to apply the redesign.
</p>

<p>
    With the thought of maintainability in mind, I built up a Bootstrap-based framework to provide the responsive layout familiar to many, whilst providing custom components for all inputs, informed by the UI designs provided. The app was built mobile-first, but I extended this to both tablet and desktop form factors ensuring an appropriate layout and UX for any device.
</p>

<p>
    This project really pushed my CSS knowledge to the limit. Constrained by requirements to make sure the app worked on a large range of browsers and devices, along with making sure the UI was smooth for the users via animations and transitions, this was a great challenge.
