    As developers, it's important to make user's lifes as easy as possible. Adding quick actions into our apps enhances
    the UX and can provide additional value for users. Many browser apps such as Chrome, Edge & Safari have
    shortcuts to open a new incognito tab and the Shazam app includes the ability to initiate a search straight from the
    home screen, saving crucial seconds when you're trying to identify that snippet of a song.

<p>
    After trying to find a Plugin that would allow me to add shortcuts into my app and falling short, I decided to build
    my own open source library and provide the functionality for others to use.
</p>

<p>
    The plugin provides developers with the ability to add shortcuts to their Xamarin Android, Xamarin iOS & native UWP apps,
    or within a Xamarin Forms app that implements 1 or more of the platforms. As part of the native implementation, iOS 
    provides a number of native icons that can be assigned as part of the icon creation. In order to provide parity between 
    platform's APIs, the plugin ships with a matching set of icons for both Android & UWP which were put together by myself,
    ensuring the Plugin is as rich as possible.
</p>

<p>
    Following samples provided by James Montemagno, the original version was architected using a shared project and conditional 
    compilation. Maintaining the plugin across three platforms with so many projects all sharing parts of the code-base was quite
    a challenge. With the introduction of .Net Standard 2.0 support in Xamarin Forms, I decided to refactor the project to use a 
    multi-targeted platform approach, which simplified the project structure and makes maintenance much easier.
