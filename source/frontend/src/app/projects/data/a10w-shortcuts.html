    As developers, it's important to make user's lifes as easy as possible. Adding quick actions into our apps enhances
    the UX and can provide additional value for users. For example, many browser apps like Chrome, Edge & Safari have
    shortcuts to open a new incognito tab and the Shazam app includes the ability to initiate a search straight from the
    home screen, saving crucial seconds when you're trying to identify that snippet of a song.

<p>
    After trying to find a Plugin that would allow me to add shortcuts into my app and falling short, I decided to build
    my own open source library and provide the functionality for others to use.

<p>
    Initially, built using a shared project and conditional compilation, I refactored to use a multi-targeted platform
    approach, which simplified the project structure and made maintenance much easier.
