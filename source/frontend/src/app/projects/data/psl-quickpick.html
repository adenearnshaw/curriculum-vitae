    Quickpick is a fully native Java & Kotlin Android app designed to work on both devices with built in scanners and
    regular devices with cameras to improve the picking accuracy of pharmacies when fulfilling patient's prescriptions.
</p>

<p>
    The app helps improve accuracy by allowing pickers to select digital prescriptions or scan physical ones and curates
    an optimised list of the drugs that need to be fulfilled. Pickers fulfil the items on the list by scanning either
    the 1D or 2D barcodes on each drug pack which then validating if the drug scanned is the correct product, dose and
    quantity. The app provides audio, haptic and visual cues for each product and allows pickers to confidently pack
    each prescription with greater speed.

    I adopted this project when it was about 75% complete towards an initial release. The app architecture had been
    copied from a legacy application that was heavily Activity-based with no real modern features like Fragments,
    Navigation Graph or Unit Tests. With the aim to get the product into a pilot phase as soon as possible, I
    prioritised functionality over the tech-debt, taking chunks out of that during further development phases as part of
    process of improving stability and maintainability.
</p>
<p>
    Currently the app runs a hybrid of both Java & Kotlin and whilst mostly still Layout-based, some Jetpack Compose
    views have been introduced as the number of devices the app targets increases.
