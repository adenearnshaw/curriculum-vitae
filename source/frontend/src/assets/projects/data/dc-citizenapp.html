    The Citizen App from Democracy Counts was imagined to be a white label solution provided to local authorities to be used by households within their administrative region. 
    The requirements for the app included the ability for electors to register themselves to vote; change their personal details; confirm all the members of their household; view local representative; communicate with their local authority and receive notifications back.

    Embarking into a new sector, I had very little knowledge of the internal workings of managing the electorate, but with a deadline of 3 weeks to produce a working prototype for an annual trade show, I had my hands full.

    During that time I learnt how councils manage enrollment on the electoral register and what's required of local councils in order for them to lawfully carry out their duties as election officials. 
    Working alone, I had to design and build the app from scratch, ensuring the features required were introduced quickly, but in such a way that the code would be resiliant too.

    I decided to use Xamarin Native as the primary technology stack, as there was a desire to highly customise the look and feel of the UI, while keeping startup speed paramount. 
    Using a multi-tiered approach, I built the project with separate Logic & UI layers, concentrating on building up a prototype on Android first, with a view to building the iOS UI at a later date. 
    Despite only spending a couple of months on the project, I was really pleased with app infrastructure I established, and received positive feedback from other devs who took over the piece.
